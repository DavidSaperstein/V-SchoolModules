                <p>"oh, sure I bet it'd be exciting at first, going to see 8 p.m. showings of movies, shopping at those big department stores, and maybe even eating at one of those fancy restaurants that doesn't use iceberg lettuce in their salads," Linder said. "But I just don't think I could put up with all that hub-bub for more than a day or two."</p>
                <p>Added Linder: "And parking's a nightmare there."</p>
